# Systems Test
Designing a framework in which asynchronous actors can be started on separate threads and communicate with each other using messages.
Similar to Actix, but instead of a general purpose library providing actor functionalities, this is an actor *framework* specifically for embedded development.

### Note
This is just a minimal viable demo.
